   <h3>FDSN Web Service Check</h3>

<p>FDSN web service <a href="http://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.1.pdf">specification</a>.</p>

<p>This runs tests against FDSN web serices from within the browser. The means that we are making XMLHttpRequest from javascript that is loaded from our web server to the web server hosting the web service. If that server is not configured to allow queries from pages loaded from other sites, the request will fail. This is true even if the URL is accessible and working when directly entered into the browser. We believe that FDSN web services should in general be available in this manner. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Wikipedia</a> article and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">Mozilla</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">W3C</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In the case of failures, it is often helpful to look at the javascript console as additional debugging information can appear there. In particular, CORS errors are logged to the console, but the javascript does not receive them. Tests stop on the first failure within each type. <span class="success">Green</span> tests are passes, <span class="fail">red</span> tests are failure and <span class="failOpinion">yellow</span> are just my opinion.</p>

<p>Warning, because the data the remote service has access to is not enocoded in these test, there is a reasonable chance of false postives and false negatives. These tests also represent my reading of the FDSN Web Service Specification, and hence reflect my biases. And there is always the chance of bugs in the javascript that runs the tests. Comments are welcome, you can email me (Philip Crotwell) at  crotwell <b>at</b> seis.sc.edu.</p>
